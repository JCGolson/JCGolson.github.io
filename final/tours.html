          <p class="first">Cozumel possesses a quiet, cool, authenticity unlike no other.</p>
          <p>Famed for its scuba diving, it’s a haven for nature and adventure lovers alike.</p>
          <p>Although you are removed from the heart of the action (who knows you may even like it more), there are lots
            of things to do on the island.</p>
          <p>All you need to know right now is that it is the epitome of Caribbean bliss, and everyone should experience
            it at least once.</p>

        <div class="tours2-p">
          <p class="first">If diving is your thing, or you would like to be able to finally tick it off your bucket list this is the
            perfect opportunity to see some of the world’s most famous reefs.</p>
          <p>At Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park, there are diving spots around a section of the Mesoamerican Reef and
            the Museo Subacuático de Arte’s submerged sculptures that are definitely worth checking out.</p>
          <p>There’s also an eco-park called Chankanaab surrounding a lagoon with underwater caverns, home to dolphins,
            manatees and sea turtles.</p>

        <div class="tours1-p">
          <p class="first">If you have the means and feel confident, hop on a scooter and take a leisurely ride around the island to
            soak up the incredible views!</p>
          <p>There are two roads to follow, one is narrower and sits closer to the coast consequently providing better
            views.</p>
          <p>It is supposedly reserved for use of bicycles.</p>
          <p>However… it is in practice used mostly by scooters, and we also encountered cars and jeeps on the same
            road.</p>

      <h2>Beaches on Cozumel</h2>

          <img src="images/ph-2.jpg" data-src="images/cozumel-1351419-sm.jpg" alt="Beaches in Cozumel">
        </div>
        <div class="tours2-p">
          <p class="first">There are many great beaches and beach clubs on the island of Cozumel, such as Chankanaab National Park,
            Paradise Beach, Playa San Francisco and Playa Palancar. These beaches can be found about 5-10 miles (8-16
            km) south of the main town and cruise ship piers.</p>
          <p>The east side of the island has a more rugged coastline and offers miles of quiet windswept beaches.</p>

      <h2>The Eastern Shore of Cozumel</h2>

      <div class="tours1">

          <img src="images/ph-2.jpg" data-src="images/beaches-sm.jpg" alt="Eastern Shore of Cozumel">
        </div>
        <div class="tours1-p">
          <p class="first">You can’t swim on this side of the island – not safely, anyway. The waves pound the rocky shoreline and
            curl back, creating powerful undertows.</p>
          <p>The view, however, is magnificent, and the road that hugs the edge of the coast is a great scenic route,
            begging to be seen, experienced and enjoyed!</p>
          <p>People who drive along here often pull over and park to gaze out across the shore and enjoy the wonderful
            atmosphere of the area. There are some restaurants along the route too, waiting to serve you the fresh catch
            of the day or a refreshing fruit juice cocktail. You will see and hear wildlife everywhere in this area;
            exotic birds and big iguanas greet visitors on their tour along this amazing shoreline.</p>

      <h2>Boat Cruises from Cozumel</h2>

      <div class="tours2">
        <div class="tours2-img">
          <img src="images/ph-2.jpg" data-src="images/boat-1330415-sm.jpg" alt="Tour Boat">
        </div>
        <div class="tours2-p">
          <p class="first">Touring boat trips are available for those who want to explore some of the waters around the island. Some
            tours can include stops that allow you to dive off and snorkel around the luscious waters; others stop at
            beautiful remote beaches and serve a nice lunch. Glass hulled boats are also on offer; these cruise around
            the shallow reefs and give you a window into the marine world surrounding Cozumel.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <hr class="style-seven">
      <h2>Chankanaab National Park</h2>

      <div class="tours1">
        <div class="tours1-img">
          <img src="images/fish-1733504-sm.jpg" alt="Fish">
        </div>
        <div class="tours1-p">
          <p class="first">At the center of this park—and the pride of the island’s local people— there is a land-locked pool (cenote)
            connected by an underground tunnel to the sea. The name Chankanaab loosely translates to mean “little sea”,
            named after the natural pool.</p>
          <p>You can snorkel in the sea and the beach at the park is wonderful—one of the best on the island; it’s
            perfect for sunbathing. Entrance to the water is by means of stone steps. You’ll find restaurants, toilets
            and a few shops here, too.</p>
          <p>Some natural gardens, home to sub-tropical plants from over twenty countries (450+ species), surround the
            lagoon, and nice pathways have been constructed, along with some replica Mayan statues and ‘ruins’, to
            complete the setting. The park is open every day from 8am and closes around 5pm.</p>

      <h2>Mayan Ruins</h2>

      <div class="tours2">
        <div class="tours2-img">
          <img src="images/ph-2.jpg" data-src="images/san-gervasio-site-1534348-sm.jpg" alt="San Gervasio">
        </div>
        <div class="tours2-p">
          <p class="first">The San Gervasio (pronounced “Her-vah-sio”) ruins, which date back to 100 BC, can be found on Cozumel;
            they, like all of the other archaeological sites in the area, are very popular with visitors from all over
            the world.</p>
          <p>Mayan women made a pilgrimage to the temple here as it was thought that Ixchel, the goddess of fertility,
            resided locally and would help them to conceive if they trotted across to visit the island from the
            mainland. All Mayan women tried to make at least one pilgrimage here from the mainland at some point in
            their life.</p>
          <p>These ruins have more symbolism than majesty about them, unlike some of the mainland Mayan ruins which have
            both. Half of the fun of this excursion is getting there. Don’t expect to see the most amazing ruins
            ever—you won’t. What you will see is a modest temple that was extremely significant to women, especially
            during the days of the Mayan civilization.</p>
