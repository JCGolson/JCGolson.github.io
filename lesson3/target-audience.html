                <h4>Target Audience</h4>

                <p>The target audience is people who like to do outdoor activities. The website will help them to find out if the weather will be condusive to their activities.</p>

                <p><strong>Personas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Martin is retired and loves to be outdoors, whether it's working in his yard, going for walks with his wife or going kayaking and fishing. He would use the site to check the weather conditions before finalizing plans for his outdoor activities.</li>

                    <li>Janice is a 45 year old woman who works long hours during the week and likes to do yardwork or go hiking on the weekends. She wants to be able to know what the weather is like on those days that she has free, so that she can decide if she will be able to do any of the things she has planned.</li>
             </ul>

             <p><strong>Scenarios:</strong></p>
             <ol>
                <li>It rained last night, but will it be clear today so we can go kayaking?</li>
                <li>How hot will it be today? Will it be too hot to mow the yard?</li>
                <li>It's cloudy outside, and I want to go hiking. Is there only a chance of light sprinkles, or is it more likely to be stormy?</li>
                <li>We've been having a heat wave for the last several days. Will it be cooler today so we can go to the zoo?</li>
                <li>What will the temperature be like today? I want to stain the deck but can't do it if it's below a certain temperature.</li>
             </ol>
